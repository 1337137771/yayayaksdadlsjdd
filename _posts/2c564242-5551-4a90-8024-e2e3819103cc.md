# C# Loops
When it comes to programming in C#, loops play a crucial role in achieving efficient iteration and controlling the flow of execution. Loops enable developers to repeat a block of code multiple times until a certain condition is met, allowing for repetitive tasks and complex algorithms to be easily implemented.

## C# While Loop
In C#, the while loop is a fundamental control structure that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition remains true. It is used when the number of iterations is uncertain at the beginning, and the loop continues until the condition evaluates to false.
```csharp
while (condition)
{
    // Code to be executed
}
```

## C# Do-While Loop
In C#, the do-while loop is a control structure that allows you to execute a block of code at least once, and then repeatedly execute it as long as a specified condition remains true. It is similar to the while loop, but with a slight difference in the evaluation of the condition.
```csharp
do
{
    // Code to be executed
} while (condition);
```

## C# For Loop
In C#, the for loop is a powerful control structure that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly for a specified number of iterations. It is particularly useful when you know the exact number of iterations in advance or when iterating over elements of an array or collection.
```csharp
for (initialization; condition; iteration)
{
    // Code to be executed
}
```
